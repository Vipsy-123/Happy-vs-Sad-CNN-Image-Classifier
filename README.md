# Machine Learning Pipeline for Binary Classification of Happy or Sad Images using TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification of images into "Happy" or "Sad" categories. The pipeline uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. The dataset is sourced from Google and consists of images labeled as either happy or sad.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.12
- TensorFlow 2.12.0
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Images Dataset (link provided below)
- Anaconda Navigator

## Installation

Install anaconda navigator for using Tensorflow:
* You can refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejzubp-B83o&t=1165s) by Simplilearn to install tensorflow on Anaconda
  

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage :
