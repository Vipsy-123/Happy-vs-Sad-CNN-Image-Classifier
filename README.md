# Machine Learning Pipeline for Binary Classification of Happy or Sad Images using TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification of images into "Happy" or "Sad" categories. The pipeline uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. The dataset is sourced from Google and consists of images labeled as either happy or sad.

## Requirements 

- Python 3.10.12
- TensorFlow 2.12.0
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Images Dataset(link provided below)
- Anaconda Navigator

## Installation 

Install anaconda navigator for using Tensorflow:
* You can refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejzubp-B83o&t=1165s) by Simplilearn to install tensorflow on Anaconda
  
* Create a different environment on Anaconda :
```bash
 conda create _your_env_name_
```
* Install Jupyter Notebook:
 ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
  ```
* Open anaconda-navigator and install Tensorflow 2.12.0(recommended) and Jupyter Labs on your environment

## Usage 

* Clone this Repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vipsy-123/Happy-vs-Sad-CNN-Image-Classifier.git

```

* Copy the dataset from this Repository :

  > Google Images Dataset - https://github.com/Vipsy-123/Happy-vs-Sad-CNN-Image-Classifier/tree/main/data


* Open anaconda-navigator in base terminal:
  
```bash
 anaconda-navigator # e.g (base)vipul@vipul-predator:~$ anaconda-navigator

```
* Open Jupyter Labs and Copy this [notebook](https://github.com/Vipsy-123/Happy-vs-Sad-CNN-Image-Classifier/blob/main/Image_Sentiment_Classifier.ipynb)
